# Writing Exponents in Google Forms

Ways to enter exponent characters in Google Forms question prompts.

## ASCII

The simplest approach may be to keep it simple and [use ASCII for entering
exponents](http://mathforum.org/typesetting/ascii.guidelines.html), a la:

    y = ax^2 + bx + c

## Unicode

It's possible to write true exponents on one line by using [special Unicode
characters that represent super- (and sub-) script
letters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode_subscripts_and_superscripts).
This looks nice, but has a downside: _students cannot easily replicate this in
their responses_.
